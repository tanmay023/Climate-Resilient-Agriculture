1. Adaptation Domain: Climate-Crop Dynamics
This area focuses on how your ML models will predict yield risks based on shifting environmental variables.
Key Knowledge Points:
Climate Thresholds: Understanding "Critical Temperatures" (e.g., when heat prevents pollination in wheat) and "Growing Degree Days" (GDD).
Hydrological Stress: How erratic rainfall patterns (delays in monsoon, dry spells) impact different growth stages (vegetative vs. flowering).
Pollution Exposure: The role of Ozone (O3) and Black Carbon in stunting photosynthesis and reducing crop "greenness" (NDVI).
Extreme Event Attribution: Differentiating between seasonal variation and extreme events like heatwaves or flash floods.

2. Mitigation Domain: Energy & Water Efficiency
This area focuses on using ML to optimise the "Green Farm" infrastructure, specifically demand-side management of renewable energy.
Key Knowledge Points:
Solar & Wind Forecasting: Understanding GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) for solar and Wind Shear/Speed for windmills. Models like LSTMs are used here for time-series forecasting.
Energy Demand Prediction: Calculating the "Peak Load" of irrigation pumps and processing units to ensure the renewable micro-grid doesn't fail.
Precision Irrigation (Smart Water): Learning about Evapotranspiration (ET) rates. ML helps in "Deficit Irrigation"—applying just enough water to keep the plant alive without wasting energy on over-pumping.
Grid Management: Strategies for energy storage (batteries) and distribution according to real-time farm usage data.

1. Project Objectives
These are the specific goals your project aims to achieve. They should be "SMART" (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
Predictive Adaptation: To develop machine learning models (like Random Forest or XGBoost) that predict crop yield variability based on temperature, rainfall, and air pollution (O3, NO2) fluctuations, pollution exposure, etc
Energy Optimisation: To create a forecasting system for wind speed and solar radiation to optimise the scheduling of farm operations (like irrigation) using renewable energy.
Water Conservation: To build an intelligent irrigation trigger system that reduces water waste by analysing soil moisture and evapotranspiration data.
Impact Assessment: To quantify the economic benefits of switching from traditional grid-dependent farming to climate-resilient, renewable-powered agriculture.

2. Project Scope
The scope defines the "boundaries." It tells your team what is included and what is excluded so the project doesn't become too large to manage.
What is IN Scope:
Data Analysis: Historical climate data (10–20 years), air quality indices, and renewable energy potential (GHI/Wind speed).
Model Development: Building and comparing at least 2–3 ML models (e.g., Regression for yield, LSTMs for energy forecasting).
Feature Engineering: Identifying which factors (like "Heat stress days" or "PM2.5 levels") most significantly affect farm productivity.
Strategy Formulation: A final recommendation report on when to plant and how to distribute power.
What is OUT of Scope:
Hardware Implementation: We are not physically building the sensors or installing solar panels; we are building the intelligence (the software/model) behind them.
Real-time IoT Cloud Hosting: We will focus on historical and simulated real-time data rather than a live 24/7 cloud deployment.
Genetic Engineering: We are suggesting "Climate-Smart Varieties," not actually developing them in a lab.


1. Adaptation: Predicting Yield & Pollution Risks
Since agricultural data (yield vs. climate) often has complex, non-linear relationships, simple linear models might fail.
Random Forest (RF) & XGBoost:
Why: These are "Ensemble" models. They are excellent at handling "tabular" data like temperature, rainfall, and PM2.5 levels to predict crop yield. They are less prone to overfitting than a single decision tree.
Study Goal: Learn how "Feature Importance" works to see which variable (e.g., heat or ozone) hurts the crop most.
Support Vector Regression (SVR):
Why: Good for smaller datasets where you need to find a line that "best fits" the data while ignoring minor outliers.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
Why: If your team decides to use satellite imagery or leaf photos to assess health (NDVI), CNNs are the industry standard for image recognition.
2. Mitigation: Renewable Energy & Water Forecasting
Renewable energy (Wind/Solar) and water usage are Time-Series problems—the value today depends on the value yesterday.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:
Why: A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to remember patterns over long periods. Essential for predicting solar radiation and wind speed based on historical weather trends.
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR):
Why: A "baseline" model. Use this first to see if simple correlations between wind speed and power generation are enough before moving to complex AI.
Prophet (by Meta):
Why: An easy-to-use tool specifically for forecasting time-series data that has strong "seasonality" (e.g., more solar power in summer, more wind in monsoon).
